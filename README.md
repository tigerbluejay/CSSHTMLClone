# My First Small Project - Creating a Web Page out of a Sample Image

This simple yet valuable project recreates a static web page based on a provided sample image, using only HTML and CSS. It was my first attempt at translating a visual design into functional code, helping me grasp essential layout techniques, positioning, and styling. The goal was to match the design as closely as possible, focusing on attention to detail, semantic HTML, and clean CSS structure. Though small, this project laid the groundwork for understanding how web design translates into frontend development.
